# moarchy-keep

Notes and checklists for a Linux phone, in the shape of Google Keep: a two
column grid of coloured cards, a note that fills the screen when you tap it, and
nothing between typing and it being saved.

<p align="center"><em>360×720, the size of a PinePhone's screen under

from the active Omarchy theme, here tokyo-night.</em></p>

Built for [mobileomarchy](https://github.com/SimonSchubert/mobileomarchy), but
nothing in it is specific to that: it is a GTK4/libadwaita app and runs on
Phosh, Plasma Mobile, postmarketOS or an ordinary desktop.

## What it does

- **Text notes and checklists**, and either can become the other
- **A masonry grid**, so a two-word note takes two words of space
- **Nine colours**, pinning, search, and a single-column view
- **Everything local.** One JSON file, no account, no network code in the app

## Two kinds of note, one card

A note is prose or it is a list of tick boxes, and the menu turns one into the
other without losing anything — converting a list to text keeps each ticked item
as a `✓`, converting back splits on lines. Ticked items drop to the bottom of the
list under a heading that collapses them, which is what stops a shopping list
from being mostly things you have already bought.

Typing is the whole interaction. Enter at the end of a list item makes the next
one, backspace at the start of an empty one removes it, and a note you open and
back out of without typing is discarded rather than left as a blank card.

## The colours come from your theme

Keep's identity is coloured notes. Omarchy's is that one `omarchy-theme-set`
recolours everything at once. Shipping Google's yellow would have made this the
one surface on the phone that ignored the theme, so the nine note colours are
*derived* instead: each is a hue from the active theme — its red, its orange, its
green — mixed a short way into the theme's own background.

| theme | Coral | Sand | Mint | Fog |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tokyo-night (dark) | `#4f313f` | `#4a3f36` | `#3a4636` | `#313b58` |
| rose-pine (light) | `#e5c8ca` | `#f5dab5` | `#bbcacd` | `#c9d7d6` |

Same code, same nine names: deep and desaturated on a dark theme, pastel on a
light one. With no Omarchy installed it falls back to the GNOME palette and
looks deliberate rather than broken.

pastel on the right, with no restart between
them](docs/screenshots/theme-switch.png)

The stylesheet is rebuilt when `colors.toml` changes, so `omarchy-theme-set`
repaints the notes in place — the two halves of that picture are one run of the
app, a second apart, with the theme file replaced in between.

## Where the notes live

`~/.local/share/moarchy-keep/notes.json`, and that is the whole storage layer.
A phone holding a few hundred notes does not need a database, and a plain file
can be read by anything, diffed, synced with rsync or git, and repaired by hand —
which `sqlite3 .dump` cannot be on a device with no keyboard.

Writes go to a temporary file, an fsync, a rename, and an fsync of the
directory. On a phone "killed while saving" is the ordinary case rather than the
strange one: the compositor kills backgrounded apps under memory pressure and
the battery is the only power supply. A note that was saved stays saved, and an
interrupted save leaves the previous file untouched rather than half of the new
one. Typing is written out half a second after you stop.

If the file cannot be parsed it is **kept, not overwritten**: it is moved to
`notes.broken-<timestamp>.json`, the app starts empty and says so, and it will
not save over what it could not read.

## Install

```bash
yay -S moarchy-keep
```

Or run it from a checkout with `python3 -m moarchy_keep`.

## Checking it without a phone

The app needs GTK4, libadwaita and a display server, none of which a Mac has.
The container has all three at the versions Arch Linux ARM ships, and on Apple
Silicon it runs natively:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -f docker/Dockerfile.dev -t moarchy-keep-dev .
docker run --rm --platform linux/arm64 -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src moarchy-keep-dev ./scripts/check.sh
```

`scripts/check.sh` lints, runs the tests — the storage ones, plus widget tests
that build the real window on the virtual screen and call what the buttons call —
and then **starts the app and fails on any GTK warning**. That last part is the one
that matters: a GTK layout error is not an exception. The app starts, the window
appears, one widget is the wrong size or missing, and a single line on stderr is
the only sign — which on a phone goes to a journal nobody reads.

Two scripts go further:

- `scripts/interact.sh` taps the app with `xdotool` — takes a note, types a
  title and a body, makes a list, presses Enter for the next item — and then
  asserts against `notes.json`. Screenshots prove it draws; this proves that
  tapping "Take a note…" writes a note that survives being closed.
- `scripts/screenshot.sh` photographs it, optionally under a real Omarchy
  palette: `./scripts/fetch-themes.sh /tmp/themes` then
  `THEME=/tmp/themes/tokyo-night/colors.toml ./scripts/screenshot.sh`.

The cairo renderer these use is not a compromise for the container: the
PinePhone's Mali-400 tops out at GLES 2.0, so GTK falls back to software
rendering there too. What is photographed here is what the phone draws.

## Status

Runs clean under the checks above — 44 tests, no GTK warnings, and the
interaction script passing — on Arch Linux ARM at 360×720.

**It has now run on the phone.** `scripts/device.sh` builds the package, installs
it with pacman, launches it through the compositor and photographs the result.
What that showed:

- It installs and starts. `pacman -U` is clean, `desktop-file-validate` passes,
  and the app appears in the drawer under its own icon — so it is reachable by
  tapping rather than only from a shell.
- It renders correctly at 720×1440 under the live theme, and the note colours
  derived from `colors.toml` look on the device the way they look in the
  container.
- One warning in the log, and it is the expected one: `Unable to create a GL
  context`. The Mali-400 has no usable GL, GTK falls back to software rendering,
  and that is the case this app was drawn flat for.
- First launch is slow — more than six seconds to first paint on a cold cache,
  sometimes past fourteen. Warm launches are quick. Worth knowing before
  concluding that a launch failed.

### Known issue: you cannot type into it on the phone yet

Tapping a text field does not raise the on-screen keyboard. The note opens, the
tap lands, the cursor appears — and no keyboard. On a notes app that is close to
fatal, and it is this app's bug rather than the keyboard's:

```
moarchy-keep      tap a list item:  0 text-input objects, 0 enter events, workspace stays 674
gnome-text-editor same session:     1 object, 1 enter, workspace 674 → 474
```

moarchy-keyboard raises itself when a client enables Wayland text input, so a
client that never enables it leaves the keyboard correctly down. Under
`WAYLAND_DEBUG=1` this app either never calls `get_text_input` at all or calls
it without ever receiving the `enter` that would let it enable — while a stock
GTK4 app in the same session does both. A window whose whole content is one
`GtkTextView`, built by this same application class, also does both, so the
fault is somewhere in the widget structure between the two.

That is as far as the evidence goes. Several tidier explanations — that pages
pushed onto `AdwNavigationView` break it, that it is a focus-timing race, that a
text widget must exist before the surface gets keyboard focus — each looked
convincing for one run and were overturned by the next; on a 1.15GHz A53 with a
shared screen, a single run is not a measurement. What holds up under repetition
and against a same-session control is only the table above.

A hardware keyboard is unaffected. The other open question is whether a long
press on a card competes with the shell's own gestures.

## Not in this version

Labels, archive, reminders, images, drawing, voice notes, sharing and sync. Keep
has all of them; this has notes, lists and colours, which is the part that is
used every day. The storage format has room for the rest — every note carries an
id and timestamps — but nothing here is waiting on them.
